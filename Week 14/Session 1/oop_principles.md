# OOP Principles

## Encapsulation
- Encapsulation bundles data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), while hiding internal implementation details from outside access.
- **Key concepts:**
  - Data hiding through access modifiers (private, protected, public).
  - Controlled access via getter/setter methods.
  - Internal implementation can change without affecting external code.

## Inheritance
- Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse and establishing hierarchical relationships.

## Polymorphism
- Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class while maintaining their specific behaviors.

## Abstraction
- Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only essential features of objects. 
- It's achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.
